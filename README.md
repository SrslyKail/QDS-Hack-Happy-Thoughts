## Summary
Happy-Thoughts is a web application that aims to provide a space for students to anonymously share inspiring thoughts, experiences, or images with their peers. We hope to help them get out of an echo-chamber of worries, that our minds oftentimes are, and see how much happiness can be found in the little things in life. Posts are submitted anonymously from students in British Columbia (for now). All texts and images are stored in a Firebase-hosted database.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js for backend development.
- Firebase for login flow and database integration.
- Frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface.
